Adding GLQuake Driver Support
-----------------------------
1) Install the FULL Version (Not the Shareware version!) of Quake.

2) Copy the GLQUAKE.EXE and other associated files from the GLQuake
   ZIP file to your Quake Directory.  (Use Windows Explorer)

3) Copy the enclosed OPENGL32.DLL file to your Quake Directory.
   (Use Windows Explorer)   NOTE: DO NOT COPY OPENGL32.DLL to your
   Windows\SYSTEM directory

4) Create a Desktop Shortcut for GLQuake:  Using the right mouse button
   drag the GLQUAKE.EXE file from Windows Explorer to the Desktop.
         When prompted choose "Create Shortcut"

5) Create an autoexec.cfg file in the ID1\ directory of your quake
   installation if you do not already have one.  Add the line

   gl_playermip "2"

   to the file.

6) Start GLQuake by running the shortcut. 


Troubleshooting and Frequently Asked Questions
----------------------------------------------

1. Will GLQuake work with shareware Quake?

No, the full registered version of Quake is required.  



2. Do I need any other drivers to run GLQuake on Voodoo Graphics?

Just make sure that the FXMEMMAP.VXD file is in your Windows\SYSTEM 
directory and that DirectX 2.0, DirectX 3.0 or DirectX 3.0a are
installed as GLQuake uses DirectSound. The latest version of DirectX
can be obtained from:
	http://www.microsoft.com/mediadev/download/isdk.htm



3. I installed GLQuake and try to run the GLQUAKE.EXE file but I get a 
"no RGB fullscreen modes available"  How do I get GLQuake to run?

Make sure that your 2D video card is set to 16bit color (65K colors,
not 16 colors). In addition, do not start GLQuake from a full screen
MS-DOS prompt.



4. GLQuake comes up for a little while then drops me back to the
Windows 95 desktop, what's wrong?

Your Virtual Memory settings on your system should be increased.  Open
Control Panel, System - click on the Performance tab and then click on
Virtual Memory.  Adjust the settings so that the minimum swap file size
is 80MB.   You may also want to delete all the mesh files - do this by
deleting the quake\ID1\glquake directory.



5. Why does GLQuake try to connect to my Internet connection whenever
it starts?

GLQuake uses Windows networking. Auto-Dial is likely enabled in your
Internet Control Panel or in Internet Explorer Options.  Single
Player users: To disable Network use in GLQuake and prevent the
network connection screen from coming up, add "-nolan" to the
GLQUAKE.EXE command line, example:
	GLQUAKE.EXE -nolan




6. I have a three button mouse, but I can't use or set the middle 
button in GLQuake, what's wrong?

To use a three button mouse with GLQuake, your Windows mouse driver
must support three buttons.  Use the Logitech PS/2, Serial or Bus
driver instead of the Microsoft or Standard PS/2, Serial or Bus driver.
Also, make certain that your Mouse control panel sets the middle button
to "middle" and not "double click".



7. Mouse input seems jumpy, how do I fix that?

From the console (hit the ~ tilde key), enter m_filter 1 <enter>
This option can be added to the AUTOEXEC.CFG file (in the \ID1
directory).  You may also add this option to the GLQUAKE.EXE command
line, example:
	GLQUAKE.EXE +m_filter 1



8. While playing GLQuake the sound stutters, how do I fix it?

If your sound card does not support DirectSound, you may encounter
stuttering sound during game play.  Try adding the following value to
the CONFIG.CFG file (in the quake\ID1 directory):
		 _snd_mixahead ".14"



9. When I hit ALT-TAB or the Windows start button to switch to another
application why do I return to a 640x480 display?

GLQuake by default needs to keep the 2D display at 640x480 while it is
running. To return the display to your normal setting you must exit
GLQuake.  To prevent this, add the following to the GLQUAKE.EXE command
line options "+_windowed_mouse 1" and "-window"   example:
	GLQUAKE.EXE +_windowed_mouse 1 -window



10. GLQuake multiplayer can't find other games or won't connect.

GLQuake uses Windows 95 Networking.  Verify that the correct networking
components are installed and that you can connect to the other machine
using File and print sharing or TCP/IP ping.  If you are using IPX also
make certain that the frame type is the same on all the systems.



11. GLQuake multiplayer slows down alot, how do I fix it?

Add gl_playermip 2 to the AUTOEXEC.CFG file (in the \ID1 directory)
You may however add "+gl_playermip 2" to the GLQUAKE.EXE command line,
example:
	GLQUAKE.EXE +gl_playermip 2



12. Does the Activision(r) Scourge of Armagon add-on (Mission Pack 1)
work with GLQuake?

Yes, start GLQUAKE.EXE with a "-hipnotic" switch.   Example:
	GLQUAKE.EXE -hipnotic



13. Do other 3rd party quake levels work with GLQuake?

Not all 3rd party levels have been tested, some may not work properly
or optimally.



14. Will GLQuake use a Voodoo Graphics accelerator under Windows NT?

The 3Dfx GLQuake drivers currently only work under Windows 95.  



15. After installing GLQuake the OpenGL screen savers in Windows 95
(OEMSR2) don't work. What's wrong?

The OpenGL Windows 95 screen savers in OEMSR2 will fail if you copied
the OPENGL32.DLL file that comes with GLQuake to your Windows\SYSTEM
directory.  The 3Dfx OPENGL32.DLL file only works with Quake. It will
not run with other OpenGL applications.  If you copied the 3Dfx 
OPENGL32.DLL to your Windows\SYSTEM directory and need to restore the
Microsoft provided OPENGL32.DLL, follow these steps:

	OEMSR2 Users
	------------
	1) Insert your Windows 95 CD into your CD-ROM drive
	2) Open a MS-DOS prompt, (Click Start, Programs, MS-DOS Prompt)
	3) Switch to the Windows\SYSTEM directory, ie:
		C: <enter>
		CD\Windows\system <enter>
	4) At the command prompt, enter:
		EXTRACT /A E:\WIN95 opengl32.dll <enter>
		(Substitute E:\ for your CD-ROM drive letter)
	
	Standard Windows 95 Users
	-------------------------
	1) Download and reinstall OpenGL for Windows 95 from the source
	you previously used.
		


16. How do I get support for GLQuake

GLQuake is currently unsupported.  You may however find answers to 
questions on various Quake dedicated websites.  3Dfx provides a GLQuake
newsgroup on news.3dfx.com (Newsgroup name is 3dfx.games.glquake ) to
discuss GLQuake with other users.  3Dfx also provides a regularly
updated GLQuake FAQ at: http://www.3dfx.com/game_dev/quake_faq.html



16. How do I send a bug report?

If your problem is not resolved in this document or our updated FAQ
(please see #15) and your bug is related to visual quality, performance
or stability send an email to quake_bugs@3dfx.com   - Describe your
system configuration  (CPU Type, CPU Speed, 2D Video Card type, Amount
of Memory, Virtual Memory Size..etc.) and how to recreate the bug.
