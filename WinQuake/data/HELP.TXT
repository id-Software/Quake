TECH SUPPORT
Any of the information listed below could change. Check the id software
Web Site, at www.idsoftware.com, for updates.

A. Tech Support Options
id Software does charge for technical support, but we strive to offer
this service at the lowest cost possible. Because volume on the support
lines dictate costs, we periodically adjust our rates for Voice Tech
Support. Check our web site for current pricing.

Paying for Voice or Automated Support
1 -- You can get Voice Support using a major credit card for a one-time
shot.  The system asks for your credit card number and expiration date,
then pre-authorizes your credit card for the tech support call. You will
only be billed for the number of minutes actually used.

2 -- You can assign yourself a rechargeable PIN account. The system prompts
you for your credit card information, and assigns you a PIN account number.
You can use the PIN to access Voice Support, Automated Support and the
Game Hints Line. Once your account runs out, you can charge it up again.

3 -- You may also charge up a PIN account using the number 1 (900) call-2-id.
Then call back at 1(800)ID-GAMES (1(800)434-3627), and use your new PIN to
receive all the support and hints you wish.

4 -- id Software's Game Hints Line is accessible either using a PIN account
via 1 (800) ID-GAMES (see above), or by calling 1 (900) CALL2-ID, which
places the call on your phone bill.
