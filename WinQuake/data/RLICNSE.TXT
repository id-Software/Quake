        1.      Grant of License.  ID grants to you the limited
right to use one (1) copy of the enclosed or foregoing game program
(the "Software") on a single computer.  You have no ownership or
proprietary rights in or to the Software or the written materials

person or entity, but you may exchange the Permitted Derivative
Works at no charge amongst other end-users.  The Software, together
with any archive copy thereof, shall be either returned to ID or
destroyed when no longer used in accordance with this Agreement, or
when the right to use the Software is terminated.  You agree that
the Software will not be shipped, transferred or exported into any
country in violation of the U.S. Export Administration Act (or any
other law governing such matters) and that you will not utilize, in
any other manner, the Software in violation of any applicable law.

circumstances shall you, the end-user, be permitted, allowed or
authorized to commercially exploit the Software, any data

the Commercial Exploitation License Agreement for QUAKE (the

License in ID's sole discretion. 

        6.      Restrictions Apply to Third Parties.  The
prohibitions and restrictions described herein apply to anyone in
possession of the Software and/or Permitted Derivative Works. 

        7.      Copyright.  The Software and all copyrights related
thereto (including all characters and other images generated by the
Software or depicted in the Software) is owned by ID and is protected
by United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions.
You must treat the Software like any other copyrighted material,
except that you may either (a) make one copy of the Software solely
for back-up or archival purposes, or (b) transfer the Software to a
single hard disk provided you keep the original solely for back-up or
archival purposes.  You may not otherwise reproduce, copy or disclose
to others, in whole or in any part, the Software.  You may not copy
the written materials accompanying the Software.  The same
restrictions and prohibitions regarding your use of the Software as
provided in this Agreement apply to your use of the written materials
accompanying the Software.  The written materials are owned by ID and
are protected by United States copyright laws and international
treaties.  You agree to use your best efforts to see that any user of
the Software licensed hereunder complies with this Agreement.

        8.      Limited Warranty.  ID warrants that if properly
installed and operated on a computer for which it is designed, the
Software will perform substantially in accordance with the
accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90) days
from the date of purchase of the Software.  ID's entire liability
and your exclusive remedy shall be, at ID's option, either (a)
return of the price paid or (b) repair or replacement of the
Software that does not meet ID's Limited Warranty.  To make a
warranty claim, return the Software to the point of purchase,
accompanied by proof of purchase, your name, your address, and a
statement of defect, or return the Software with the above
information to ID.  This Limited Warranty is void if failure of the
Software has resulted in whole or in part from accident, abuse,
misapplication or violation of this Agreement.  Any replacement
Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original
warranty period or thirty (30) days from your receipt of the
replacement software, whichever is longer.  This warranty allocates
risks of product failure between Licensee and ID.  ID's product
pricing reflects this allocation of risk and the limitations of
liability contained in this warranty. 

        9.      NO OTHER WARRANTIES.  ID DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER
WARRANTIES, BOTH EXPRESS IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND THE ACCOMPANYING WRITTEN
MATERIALS.  THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. 
YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO
JURISDICTION.  ID DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE
SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE OR MEET LICENSEE'S
SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.  THE WARRANTY SET FORTH ABOVE IS IN LIEU OF
ALL OTHER EXPRESS WARRANTIES WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN.  THE AGENTS,
EMPLOYEES, DISTRIBUTORS, AND DEALERS OF ID ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO
MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO THIS WARRANTY, OR ADDITIONAL WARRANTIES ON
BEHALF OF ID.  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS SUCH AS DEALER ADVERTISING OR
PRESENTATIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, DO NOT CONSTITUTE
WARRANTIES BY ID AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON. 

        10.     Exclusive Remedies.  You agree that your exclusive
remedy against ID, its affiliates, contractors, suppliers, and
agents for loss or damage caused by any defect or failure in the
Software regardless of the form of action, whether in contract,
tort, including negligence, strict liability or otherwise, shall be
the return of the purchase price paid or replacement of the
Software.  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and
governed by the laws of the State of Texas. Copyright and other
proprietary matters will be governed by United States laws and
international treaties.  IN ANY CASE, ID SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES ARISING FROM
BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER LEGAL
THEORY EVEN IF ID OR ITS AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY.  Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
exclusion may not apply to you. 

        11.     General Provisions.  Neither this Agreement nor any
part or portion hereof shall be assigned, sublicensed or otherwise
transferred by you.  Should any provision of this Agreement be held
to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal by a court, the
validity and enforceability of the other provisions shall not be
affected thereby.  If any provision is determined to be
unenforceable, you agree to a modification of such provision to
provide for enforcement of the provision's intent, to the extent
permitted by applicable law.  Failure of a party to enforce any
provision of this Agreement shall not constitute or be construed as
a waiver of such provision or of the right to enforce such
provision.  If you fail to comply with any terms of this Agreement,
YOUR LICENSE IS AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATED. 

        YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, THAT YOU
UNDERSTAND THIS AGREEMENT, AND UNDERSTAND THAT BY CONTINUING THE
INSTALLATION OF THE SOFTWARE, BY LOADING OR RUNNING THE SOFTWARE, OR
BY PLACING OR COPYING THE SOFTWARE ONTO YOUR COMPUTER HARD DRIVE, YOU

FURTHER AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR WRITTEN SEPARATE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN ID
AND YOU, THIS AGREEMENT IS A COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE

PRIOR ORAL AGREEMENTS, PROPOSALS OR UNDERSTANDINGS, AND ANY OTHER
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN ID AND YOU RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF
THIS AGREEMENT.
