A brief readme added by Wyatt Ward.

Best viewed in a monospace font, like Courier, Courier New, or what I use
for my terminal and nano, 9-point WenQuanYi Micro Hei Mono. I don't know
why it's called that but the font looks really good.

I added this readme and some updated Makefiles, as well as tweaking a few of
Quake's source files, to make it work properly on a modern Linux system.
I did _not_ change any parts of the game to make it look all pretty, or
to bring new improvements in graphics to the game. I only changed what was
_absolutely essential_ to run the game.

The original, unmodified source can be found here:

A good how-to for arguments and troubleshooting and such is here:
http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Quake-HOWTO-1.html

=================================================
:    WHAT THIS IS / GENERAL BACKGROUND INFO	:
=================================================


The how-to did not mention a few problems, which I created fixes for. These
include the mouse not working to allow input and no input whatsoever (not even
the keyboard) working in fullscreen. I also fixed a buffer overflow caused by
the sheer number of OpenGL extensions that modern systems support (the game
tries to print them to the console, and in doing so causes a buffer overflow
because the string containing all of the extensions is larger than the game
expected). The only noticeable difference my tweaks have caused (besides the
fact that you now can play the game) is that this string of OpenGL extensions
is no longer printed to the terminal (which I doubt most people care about,
anyway). I promise I made no tweaks to functionality or controls that would
make it differ from the original.

:	COMPILING QUAKE FOR LINUX		:
=================================================
	++++++++++++++
	| DISCLAIMER |
	++++++++++++++

	I have only built this on 32-bit Linux Mint 14.
	It should work on 64 bit, but will have to be
	Compiled with 32-bit libraries and binaries. I
	think this is merely due to some assembly used,
	and some changes to update the assembly to the
	x86_64 architecture could make this work in 64
	bit OSes natively.

With that out of the way here is how to compile it:
For the OpenGL GLX version (the high-quality version most sane people want),
go to the directory 'WinQuake' and type

    $ make build_release

The makefile named 'Makefile.linuxi386' is the original one from id, which
does not work anymore. The GLX and X11 makefiles are derived from this one,
but do successfully build. Use them instead! 

The file 'Makefile.Linuxi386.glx' should be the same as the normal 'Makefile'.

	++++++++++++
	| X11 Port |
	++++++++++++

For the X11 version, the only version I even tried to port and which works
well, is simpler to build, has fewer dependencies, and has fewer hardcoded
paths, but is lower quality graphics-wise, do

    $ make -f Makefile.Linuxi386.X11 build_release

=================================================
:	POTENTIAL BUILD PROBLEMS		: 
=================================================

	| Libraries |
	+++++++++++++

If you are missing libraries, headers or whatnot, it will let you know about
it quite loudly. You will need a few headers from the linux kernel; if you
use ubuntu or an ubuntu variant, the headers should be under something like

/usr/src/linux-headers-3.5.0-44/arch/x86/include

and

/usr/src/linux-headers-3.5.0-44-generic/include

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	$	YOU DO NOT HAVE TO COMPILE THE KERNEL.		$
	$	YOU DO NOT HAVE TO COMPILE THE KERNEL.		$
	$	YOU DO NOT HAVE TO COMPILE THE KERNEL.		$
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		...Although if you do, enable OSS while you are at it.
			This can be worked around if you don't compile.
		All we need is the source files. We have no reason to
		compile it unless that's something you would normally do
		anyway.

These will have to be edited in the makefile if you have a different version
or architecture of the kernel than I did. Search one of the above strings to
find where I included them. Replace them appropriately with your kernel
versions. If you don't have sources, they are obtainable from most package
managers, including apt. A few other paths may have to be changed in the
Makefile that I hardcoded, but you can figure those out I think.

(Look for 'wyatt' in the makefile; those paths are hardcoded, but there
may be more. I honestly don't remember. I only know that when I got the
source, id had hardcoded paths in the makefile and i simply changed the
paths to fit my environment.)

Good luck!

:	 PROBLEMS RUNNING THE GAME		:
=================================================

After building, it will be in the directory 'releasei386'.
You will need to copy the directory 'id1' from a quake CD-ROM
and place it in the 'bin' directory that your compiled game is in.

I have yet to have this problem in Linux, but in windows, I have had
blank (white) textures and a flickering display. To fix these, you can
add the parameters '-no8bit' '+gl_ztrick 0' to the launching parameters.
Note that 'gl_ztrick' _should_ have a "+" sign preceeding it instead of
a "-".

=================================================
:	SOUND PROBLEMS				:
=================================================

This game uses OSS on Linux; Most modern computers running linux (e.g.
Ubuntu, unless you built your own kernel) do not supply this. To fix,
install 'aoss' (ALSA OSS wrapper) and run the game using

    $ aoss ./glquake.glx <parameters>

to make it see a fake OSS. The alternative (which will disable sounds but
does not require any more package installations) is to pass '-nosound' to
the game when invoking.

I have not had luck getting sound in Linux Quake. I may need to have the
CD-ROM in the drive, but I lost mine years ago and only have the
installed version of the game on a old PC's hard disk. I cannot test why
sound isn't working, but I can tell you Quake complains about not seeing
a CD-ROM. I cannot answer questions about sound support.
